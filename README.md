# About ‚ùì
Minesweeper Lab is a recreation of the 1989 puzzle game, Minesweeper. In this version, there includes a training aspect: 3x3 gamemode & timed trials. The program is built to help train the user to solve Minesweeper puzzles faster. Embedded in the image below is a demonstration video. (As of 1/10/23)

# Tutorial (AI) ü§ñ
Don't quite know how to play Minesweeper? Don't sweat it! Minesweeper Lab comes with a tutorial. The slideshow explains the goal of the game and how to read the numbers throughout the puzzle. After the slideshow, an AI algorithm plays for you so that you are able to follow along. Each move has an explanation as to why the AI performed it.

# Normal and Ultimate üí£
The first of the gamemodes are default Minesweeper puzzles with two difficulties: Normal & Ultimate. Normal is an 8x12 grid with 12 mines, Ultimate is a 16x24 grid with 99 mines. High scores are saved locally.

# Timed ‚è∞
This lab gamemode forces the player to have to make a move within a selected number of seconds. The point of this gamemode is to allow the player to progressively overload their time as they play more, which will help them think faster and demonstrate real progress.

# 4x4 üèÅ
The 4x4 lab gamemode gives the player 30 seconds to solve as many 4x4 grid puzzles as possible. As a result, the player will be exposed to many common Minesweeper patterns, allowing their brain to recognize them more overtime.
